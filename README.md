# Project Description

The client requests an online automated ticket reservation system for Egyptian Premier League football matches. The system makes it possible for the management of the Egyptian Federation Association (EFA) to plan, organise, and oversee both current and upcoming matches. Users are able to reserve particular seats for the games they wish to attend through the system. The EFA management uses the system to monitor match schedules, attendance figures, match officials, and registered users.
